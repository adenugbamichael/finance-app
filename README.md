A MERN Finance Dashboard App that has Machine Learning Predictions. The frontend will consist of Vite for our starter application, Redux Toolkit for state management, Material UI for our component library, and Recharts for our Charts. For the backend we will be using Node Js as our runtime, Express Js as our backend framework, and MongoDB for our database.
